# imagine
Smooth, easy and quick way to manage images when building your awesome web apps.
The "imagine" jQuery plugin is designed for handling image properties with specific functions for setting the image source (url), resize, rotate, caption, custom style, alternative text...

The plugin allows you to apply these properties to an image element with a concise and chainable syntax.
For instance, if the image has an ID of `image` you can use 

```$("#image")
.imagine()
.url("image.jpg")
.resize("440,440")
.caption("Figure 1 Imagine, center");
```

to set the image URL, size, and caption text including the text aligment. 
The plugin provides flexibility and ease of use for managing image attributes in a fluent and jQuery-like manner.
